                  <p>We first looked into the market to examine whether existing products can help international students better order in ethnic restaurants.

                  <p class="small-margin-bottom">We found that: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Apps similar to Yelp and TripAdvisor contain restaurant menus and reviews, but <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">the content is generally American-centric.</span></li>

                    <li>With dish & ingredient names in languages like Spanish or Italian, internationals who had no exposure to those dishes still cannot understand what each dish is made of.</li>

                    <li>Internationals can use translation tools like Google Translate or Waygo to translate dish names and ingredients, but <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">these tools only provide a brief translation, with no additional information on the dish’s taste or quality.</span></li>

                    <li>People need to search for each word they don’t understand, which <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">takes time and effort.</span></li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Therefore, we hope to create a tool that can <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">tailor to the needs of internationals, to help them quickly understand what each dish is made of, and predict which dish they might like.</span></p>

                  <img class="img-responsive full-img" src="../../assets/eatxplore-affinity-mapping.jpg" alt="">  <br><br><br>


                  <p class="small-margin-bottom">We interviewed around 10 people who have stayed in the U.S. for different amount of time, ranging from 4 months to 5 years. We found that:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">Even those who have been in the U.S. for a long time struggle to understand dish names and ingredients</span> in ethnic restaurants, and need to Google them one by one.</li>

                    <li>International students usually want to see <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">pictures of the food</span>, but that is not always available on the menu.</li>

                    <li>Some people want <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">dish recommendations from those who have similar ethnic backgrounds</span> as they do; others want <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">recommendations from those who are familiar with the dish.</span></li>

                    <li>Some people have <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">difficulties pronouncing dish names</span>, which can be embarrassing in front of American friends.</li>

                  </ul>
                  <p>Because of these difficulties, a number of internationals choose to <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">stick to familiar dishes</span> when ordering in these restaurants; others end up <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">not visiting these restaurants at all</span>, even when invited by their American friends. </p>

                <h4>Personas</h4>
                <p>To better guide our design and enable everyone on the team to empathize with our users, I further synthesized the interview results and came up with the following personas:</p>

                <h4>Ideation</h4>
                <p class="small-margin-bottom">With our research findings and personas in mind, <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">I invited our engineers and the other designer to brainstorm solutions together.<span> I encouraged them to come up with as many ideas as possible without considering feasibility at this stage.</p>

                <p>We then went through the ideas and <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">discussed their implementation feasibility.</span> For example, creating a taste profile for each user based on the kind of dishes they like seems to be an excellent solution; however, the machine learning algorithm behind it would be too complex for our developers to implement within the time constraints. Therefore, <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">we had to make a compromise and provide recommendations based on users’ ethnicity as our first step.</span></p>

                <p>Eventually, we settled on the following core functionalities:</p>

              <div id="user-feedback" class="subgroup">
                <h4>User Feedback & Revised Design Goals</h4>

                <p><span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">All users liked the customized dish recommendations and the function to directly look up ingredient information.</span> This was reassuring for us, since these two functions are our primary focus, and what distinguishes us from existing apps.</p>

                <h5 class="eatxplore-h5">Avoiding Embarrassment & Empowering our Users</h5>

                <p>Some users were confused about ordering directly in the app, since it is not a convention for them to order in an app within a restaurant, especially when others sitting on the same table are still ordering by talking to the waiters/waitresses. <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">They were also afraid that by being the only one ordering in the app, they would stand out among their friends and feel embarrassed.</span> <br><br>

                Since the goal of our app is to help them feel less embarrassed while ordering in these restaurants, <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">we decided to get rid of the ordering function,</span> and focus our attention on helping them better communicate with waiters.
                <br><br>
                After talking with more users, we came to realize that one of our most important goals is to <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">empower our users</span>, who are not confident about how to order dishes right now.
                </p>

                <h5 class="eatxplore-h5">Refined Design Goals & Features</h5>

                <p>We refined our design goals and matched the features we hoped to implement to the goals we hope to achieve:</p>

                <img class="img-responsive full-img"src="../../assets/eatxplore-revised-goals.png" alt="Main Features"> <br><br><br>

                <p>The rationale for the last point is that for the international student group we’re targeting, they usually know the English language well enough to live and study in the U.S.; they just have little exposure to the diverse cuisines in the U.S., and feel intimidated to get started. <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">Therefore, instead of providing them with a tool that’s completely in their language, we hope to build something that’s primarily in English, with translations on demand.</span> In this way, we hope that our users can gradually learn the terms they don’t understand, and rely on our tool less and less as they use it more. </p>

                <p class="small-margin-bottom">For the first iteration, <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">my primary goal is to validate whether the design helps different types of users be more confident, make ordering decisions faster, feel comfortable visiting ethnic restaurants and ordering in front of people who know the cuisine well, as well as learn the basic terms of different cuisines over time.</span> I also hoped to test the <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">usability</span> of the design, so that I can improve upon it. <br><br>

Here's a brief overview of the process:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Introduce the project goal, and put users at ease.</li>
                    <li>Describe the scenario, set up the context, and let users use the app while thinking aloud.</li>

                <p class="small-margin-bottom">I was able to gather a lot of positive feedback on the prototype, from <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">users with different dietary constraints, different attitudes towards trying new food, and different familiarity levels with Mexican food</span>. Here's a summary of how people rate their own ordering speed, confidence, comfortableness in front of friends, and frequency of future visits to ethnic restaurants, with the app available:</p> <br><br>

                <p>In addition, <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">5 out of 5 users</span> believe that the tool will gradually help them learn about the common terms used in unfamiliar cuisines.

                <h5 class="eatxplore-h5">Dish Recommendations & Menu</h5>
                <p class="small-margin-bottom">Instead of dividing recommendations based on users' ethnic background and the restaurant's cuisine, <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">most users wanted to see recommendations based on all users' feedback, with the ability to apply filters as needed.</span> <br><br>

                In addition, most users did not like the restaurant's name and the menu navigation controls at the bottom. My original intention to put it there was to allow users to easily reach the navigation with their thumb to quickly navigate through the menu. However, users either did not notice it, or noticed it, but expected to be able to drag it up. <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">Since it is important to give users a sense of where they are in the app, I had to make the compromise and move the restaurant name and menu navigations to the top, so that users can notice them more easily</span>.</p>

One way to encourage users to log their orders is through gamifying the experience. <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">As a future step, I'd like to explore whether collecting stickers for dishes, badges for reviews, and using a leaderboard to compete with friends can encourage users to log and review what they ordered.</span></p>

                <h4>Customizing Dietary Constraints</h4>
                <p>People's dietary needs differ a lot. In order to better remind people of potential dietary conflicts, I'll first need to create a comprehensive list of common dietary constraints, and map them to ingredients that might conflict with them. But that's not enough. Some users reported having specific dietary needs, such as not eating carrots, garlic, or ginger. <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">To provide a more personalized experience, I'll need to enable users to select from a wide range of predefined dietary constraints, and customize them if necesssary.</span></p>

              <div id="review-filters" class="subgroup">
                <h4>Filters & Sorting Functions for Reviews</h4>
                <p>Right now, we've designed the essential function for users to filter the reviews based on their own ethnic background and the restaurant's cuisine. Some users mentioned wanting to only see 1-star reviews or 5-star reviews to get a wide range of opinions. Others wanted to sort reviews by different parameters (recency, helpfulness, etc.). <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">I'll need to conduct further research to figure out the most important filters/sorting methods that need to be implemented.</span></p>
                <!-- <p class="small-margin-bottom">I am still working on deriving design implications from the results and updating the design. I will post further updates to this project soon.</p> -->

              <div id="languages" class="subgroup">
                <h4>Designing for Different Languages</h4>
                <p>So far, the app only demonstrates the use case of a Chinese customer visiting a Mexican restaurant. What if the user is Korean? German? Indian? It is true that words are usually shorter in Chinese compared to English. <span class="highlight highlight-eatxplore">What if the user's language (e.g. German) contains longer words and looks visually similar to English?</span> That would probably influence the visual design of the app. If I were to continue this project, internationalization will be one of the major challenges in the UI Design.</p>
